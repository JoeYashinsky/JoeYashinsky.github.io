        My name is Joe Yashinsky and I'm a motivated new software developer located in Huntington Woods, MI, about 15 minutes outside of Detroit. 
I have always been a fan of solving problems and utilizing technology in the best way possible. I am very excited for all of the opportunities 
that exist in the developer field today. 

I have a wonderful wife have two young daughters that keep me on my toes whenever I'm not working on my craft. Elizabeth and Goldie (2.5 and 4 months)
are little balls of joy and could challenge any rival team of toddlers in a Peppa Pig trivia battle. Should they ever protest bedtime and try to
prolong the night, I can now utilize the wonderful world of C# by filibustering about dependency injection or interpolated strings; needless to say,
this type of dry "storytelling" has them snoring in mere seconds.

Professionally, I come from the world of journalism. I have written, broadcasted and podcasted, mainly about sports and entertainment, 
for the last 10+ years. The journey provided me many memorable moments and experiences, including an appearance on ESPN's game show, "Stump the Schwab," 
and play-by-play opportunities in Division I athletics. But I always had an interest in learning code and I decided to make the change.  

I have a wealth of experience working within tight deadlines and understand just how critical accuracy is to any project, characteristics 
I believe will  suit me well as I launch my software development career. 

I am excited to contribute to your team with a blend of passion and skill, and an unending desire to continue learning and growing as a developer.
