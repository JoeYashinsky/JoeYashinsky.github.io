        My name is Joe Yashinsky and I'm a motivated new software developer located in Huntington Woods, MI, about 15 minutes outside of Detroit. 
I have always been a fan of solving problems and utilizing technology in the best way possible. I am very excited for all of the opportunities 
that exist in the developer field today. 

I have a wonderful wife have two young daughters that keep me on my toes whenever I'm not working on my craft. Elizabeth and Goldie (2.5 and 4 months)
are little balls of joy and could challenge any rival team of toddlers in a Peppa Pig trivia battle.

Professionally, I come from the journalism world. I have written, broadcasted and podcasted, mainly about sports, for the last 10+ years. That sports
acumen provided me many memorable moments and experiences, including an appearance on ESPN's game show, "Stump the Schwab."  
I am very familiar working within tight deadlines and understood just how critical accuracy is to any project, characteristics 
I believe will  suit me well as I launch my software development career.
