My name is Joe Yashinsky and I'm a motivated new software developer in Detroit, MI. I have always been a fan of
solving problems and utilizing technology in the best way possible. I am very excited for all of the opportunities 
that exist in the developer field today.

I have two young daughters that keep me on my toes whenever I'm not working on my craft. Elizabeth and Goldie, 
both little balls of joy and oddly enough, huge fans of Humpty Dumpty. If you thought it was impossible to 
watch 45 consecutiv minutes of Humpty Dumpty videos, I can assure you that it is not.

Professionally, I come from the journalism world. I have written, broadcasted and podcasted, mainly about sports, 
for the last 10+ years.
